# PortfolioProject - ETL pipeline exploration

This is an SQL ETL project aiming to explore the automation process of the Extract-Transform-Load pipeline.

Topics that are covered in this exploration include:

EXTRACTION: Populating a database with data from various sources stored in tables using an automated process defined by multiple stored procedures.

TRANSFORMATION: Applying various technique for cleaning data and preparing for it further analysis. 
Techniques include: triming data, feature engineering, removing NULL(s) or populating empty values, removing duplicate rows and columns, standardizing data formats and organizing the columns of tables in a more consistent manner.

LOADING: Exporting the cleaned data from the database by creating a backup of its database for future application.

The datasets used throughout this project are available at https://github.com/danmarques-dt/SQL_data_cleaning_and_analysis_employees/tree/main
